# jungian-dream-analyzer

The jungian-dream-analyzer is a JESS expert system that interprets user input through the use of Jungian psychoanalysis theory. Essentially, it analyzes what your dreams mean!

The expert system simulates the process of a session with a Jungian dream analyzer, asking the user basic questions about themes prevalent in the dream in order to determine the dream's overall significance. Each answer given by a user helps determine the order of further questions and what other topics the program will ask about.

This program is intended to be run from the Jess command-line interface.
